This is a very basic survivor camp situated at the very North West of Chernarus and well off the beaten track.

It does have a well, some tools in the shed, some packets of seeds in the kitchen and theres even a pile of planks. The rest is up to you though.

This is a great little edition if you run a low food server or PvE and if you run this place right, you'll reap what you sow!

Camp Location: Chernarus 192.23/12507.58

If theres any issues, let me know!

Cheers!
